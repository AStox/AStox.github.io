  "description": "A puzzle game about making peanut butter and jam sandwiches.",
  "body1": "Ever found yourself in the kitchen late at night, struggling to make multiple PB&J sandwiches on a plate too small for all those slices of bread? Then you've had to maneuver the slices strategically, planning which need peanut butter first and which need jam next? I have, and that's what inspired this game. In PBJPuzzler, you have a limited number of plates to hold your slices and sandwiches. Your goal is to use clever stacking and the concept of 'condiment transference' to make as many sandwiches as you can. 'Condiment transference' is when an un-jammed slice of bread comes into contact with a jammed slice, transferring the jam from one slice to the other. The same goes for peanut butter.",
