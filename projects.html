  <h3><a href="heylisten.pwnz.org">Hey! Listen (v2.0)</a></h3>
    <p class="text-muted">The second version of Hey! Listen is a big improvement on the original. Hey! Listen is now primarily a collaborative internet radio app. Combining the the original idea of collaborative playlists, users can join a channel and listen to their playlist in real-time with other connected users as well as chat about it. It uses Youtube's API to query videos, and the video.js library to embed Youtube iframes. Built on Ruby on Rails, Coffeescript, Javascript, and Foundation. The video syncing functionality and chat room use websockets.

Built with Ruby/Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, and lots of AJAX.</p>
